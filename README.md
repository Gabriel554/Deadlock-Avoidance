# deadlockAvoidance
Implement the Banker's algorithm for deadlock avoidance, that works on a given set of N processes and M resource types (N<10,M<10). Use C/C++/C# or Java for the implementation, with a simple text interface, where the user enters only the name of the input file (text only). The program reads all the necessary input data from that file. 
 
The input data and result is then displayed on the screen.
